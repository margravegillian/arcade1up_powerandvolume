1. extend your volume control wires to reach your raspberry pi. use the stock connector making sure to keep the colors the same. 
2. plug the connector to the raspbarry pi. 
 the red wire should be on the very bottom left pin. reference the pi3_gpio.png 
    a. red wire to pin #39 Ground
    b. white wire to pin #37 GPIO26
    c. blue wire to pin #35 GPIO19
 
3. in your home directory create a folder named pivolume
    a. mkdir /home/pi/pivolume
    b. cd /pivolume
 
4. install python-alsaaudio
    a. sudo apt install python-alsaaudio
 
5. download the script pivolume.py or download the raw code off of githug and create your own file named pivolume.py
    a. place in the /home/pi/pivolume directory. 
    
6. run script and test
    a. make the script executable 
    chmod +x /home/pi/pivolume/pivolume.py 

    b.in the /home/pi/pivolume directory run command
    python pivolume.py
    c. you should see what volume you are currently at on the command line
    d. move the volume slider right and left. you should see a new line with the new volume going up and down as you move.
    e. ctrl+c to exit
7. add script to run everytime it boots with crontab. you can do this other ways. this worked for me
    a. enter crontab in edit mode
    b. crontab -e
    c. add a line to crontab
    @reboot /home/pi/pivolume/pivolume.py
8. reboot and enter emulationstation try a game and test the volume. I have not tried on all systems but it has worked so far on ones I use the most.
